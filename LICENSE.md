# LamaCrypt Software License

The LamaCrypt Software License ("LCSL") applies when you use the official LamaCrypt client software ("Client") to access the LamaCrypt online file storage service ("Service") and/or access the Client's source code.

## 1 General

### 1.1 License

If you agree with the LCSL, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the Client for the Service and access its source code for the purposes defined in clause 2.4.

### 1.2 Copyright

The Client and its source code remain property of LamaCrypt at all times, except if explicitely stated otherwise (for example if portions of code from another program are included).

## 2 Your obligations

### 2.1 Compliance

By using the Client and/or accessing its source code, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by all applicable legal documents. If you do not agree with an applicable legal document, you may not use the Client nor access its source code.

If you use the Client to access the Service, you must comply with the LamaCrypt Terms of Service and the following license at all times. If you only access the Client's source code, you must only comply with the following license at all times.

If you let a third party use the Client and/or access its source code, you must also make sure that this third party complies with the paragraphs above.

Neither you nor the third party to whom you give access may violate any clause of the LCSL.

### 2.2 No affiliation

You may not directly or indirectly indicate that you are affiliated with LamaCrypt in any way, shape or form. You are also forbidden to use LamaCrypt's trademarks, unless given explicit permission in this regard.

### 2.3 Attribution

Whenever you distribute some or all of the Client's source code, you must always include a notice stating that the code is subject to the LCSL and that it belongs to LamaCrypt (see clause 1.2 for more details).

### 2.4 Access

You may only use the Client to access the Service. The Client's source code may only be accessed for reviewing and commentary purposes (ex. making sure there are no embedded backdoors).

### 2.5 Modification

You may not apply changes to the Client's source code.

## 3 Disclaimers

### 3.1 Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE CLIENT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE CLIENT IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE CLIENT IS WITH YOU.

### 3.2 Limitation of liability

WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Without any limitation of the foregoing, we will not be liable for any kind of damage or loss if you have breached any of the provisions of the LCSL.

### 3.3 Waiver

Should LamaCrypt fail to enforce a right or clause of the LCSL, it does not constitute a waiver of that right or clause.

## 4 Miscellaneous

### 4.1 Modification of the LCSL

LamaCrypt may revise the LCSL at any time without prior notice, if need be. You may always access the latest version that is enforced at this page.

By continuing to use the Client and/or access its source code after the change, you implicitly approve the new version of the LCSL. If you do not approve the change, you must stop using the Client and may not access its source code.

### 4.2 Governing law

Swiss law exclusively governs all interaction between you and LamaCrypt, and all LamaCrypt legal documents are subject to it.

YOU HEREBY SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE ORDINARY COURTS IN LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, FOR ANY DISPUTES OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN YOU AND LAMACRYPT.
